This library has been migrated to a Kibo UI component called [Typography](https://www.kibo-ui.com/components/typography).

This means the CSS is installed in your `globals.css` and it's much easier to override than this library.

You can install with:

```
npx kibo-ui@latest add typography
```

Enjoy!
